## The Problem Being Solved

We consider the Poisson equation

$$-\Delta u = f$$

on a cuboid of size $$n_x \times n_y \times n_z$$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions $$u = 0$$.

It is discretized using central finite differences, leading to a symmetric positive matrix.


## The Example Source Code

For the first part of the hands-on lessons we will use the executable ij. Various solver, problem and parameter options can be invoked by adding them to the command line.
A complete set of options will be printed by typing

## Running the Example

### First Set of Runs (Krylov Solvers)

Run the first example for a small problem of size 27000 using restarted GMRES with a Krylov space of size 10.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 30 30 30 -gmres
```

#### Expected Behavior/Output

You should get something that looks like this
```
Running with these driver parameters:
  solver ID    = 4

    (nx, ny, nz) = (30, 30, 30)
    (Px, Py, Pz) = (1, 1, 1)
    (cx, cy, cz) = (1.000000, 1.000000, 1.000000)

    Problem size = (30, 30, 30)

GMRES Setup:

  wall MFLOPS     = 0.000000
  cpu clock time  = 0.000025 seconds

=============================================
Solve phase times:
=============================================
GMRES Solve:
  wall clock time = 0.170000 seconds
  wall MFLOPS     = 0.000000
  cpu clock time  = 0.169943 seconds
  cpu MFLOPS      = 0.000000


GMRES Iterations = 392
Final GMRES Relative Residual Norm = 9.915663e-09
Total time = 0.17012
```

Note the total time and the number of iterations.
Now increase the Krylov subspace by changing input to -k to 40, and finally 75.

{% include qanda question='What do you observe about the number of iterations and times?' answer='Number of iterations and times generally improve except for the last run, which is somewhat slower because the last iterations are more expensive. Iterations: 392, 116, 73. Times: 0.17, 0.11, 0.12.' %}

{% include qanda question='How many restarts were required for the last run using -k 75?'  answer='None, since the number of iterations is 73. Here full GMRES was used.'%}

Now solve this problem using -pcg and -bicgstab.

{% include qanda question='What do you observe about the number of iterations and times for all three methods? Which method is the fastest and which one has the lowest number of iterations?' answer='Conjugate gradient takes 74 iterations and 0.02 seconds, BiCGSTAB 51 iterations and 0.03 seconds. Conjugate gradient has the lowest time, but BiCGSTAB has the lowest number of iterations.' %}

{% include qanda question='Why is BiCGSTAB slower than PCG?' answer='It requires two matrix vector operations and additional vector operations per iteration, and thus each iteration takes longer than an iteration of PCG.' %}


We now consider the diffusion-convection equation

$$-\Delta u + a \nabla \cdot u = f$$

on a cuboid with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The diffusion part is discretized using central finite differences, and upwind finite differences are used for the advection term.
For $$a = 0$$ we just get the Poisson equation, but when $$a > 0$$ we get a nonsymmetric linear system.

Now let us apply Krylov solvers to the convection-diffusion equation with $$a=10$$, starting with conjugate gradient.

```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -pcg
```
{% include qanda question='What do you observe? Why?' answer='PCG fails, because the linear system is nonsymmetric.' %}

Now try GMRES(20) and BiCGSTAB.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -gmres -k 20
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -bicgstab
```

{% include qanda question='What do you observe? Which solver is faster for this problem?' answer='BiCGSTAB and GMRES both solve the problem. BiCGSTAB is faster than GMRES(20) for this problem.' %}


Now let us scale up the Poisson problem starting with a cube of size $$50 \times 50 \times 50$$ on one process:
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -pcg -P 1 1 1
```
Now we increase the problem size to a cube of size $$100 \times 100 \times 100$$
by increasing the number of processes to 8 using the process topology -P 2 2 2.
```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -pcg -P 2 2 2
```
{% include qanda question='What happens to convergence and solve time?' answer='
the number of iterations increases from 124 to 249, the time from 0.16 seconds to 0.82 seconds.' %}



### Second Set of Runs (Algebraic Multigrid)

Now perform the previous weak scaling study using algebraic multigrid starting with
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amg -P 1 1 1
```
followed by
```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amg -P 2 2 2
```

{% include qanda question='What happens to convergence and solve time now?' answer='AMG solves the problem using significantly less iterations, and time increases somewhat slower.  Number of iterations: 12, 23.
Total time: 0.32, 1.01 seconds.' %}

Now repeat the scaling study using AMG as a preconditioner for CG:
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amgpcg -P 1 1 1
```
```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amgpcg -P 2 2 2
```
{% include qanda question='What happens to convergence and solve time now?' answer='Using PCG preconditioned with AMG further decreases the number of iterations and solve times.  Number of iterations: 8, 11.  Total time: 0.30, 0.70 seconds.' %}

Now let us take a look at the complexities of the last run by printing some setup statistics:
```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amgpcg -P 2 2 2 -iout 1
```
You should now see the following statistics:
```

```
This output contains some statistics for the AMG preconditioner. It shows the number of levels, the average number of nonzeros in total and per row for each matrix $$A_i$$ as well as each interpolation operator $$P_i$$.
It also shows the operator complexity, which is defined as the sum of the number of nonzeroes of all operators $$A_i$$
divided by the number of nonzeroes of the original matrix $$A$$:
$$\frac{\sum_i^L {nnz(A_i)}}{nnz(A)}$$.
It also gives the memory complexity, which is defined by
$$\frac{\sum_i^L {nnz(A_i + P_i)}}{nnz(A)}$$.

{% include qanda question='What do you notice about the average number of nonzeroes per row across increasing levels?' answer='It increases significantly  through level 4 and decreases after that. It is much larger than the original level.'
 %}

{% include qanda question='What causes this growth?' answer='It is caused by the Galerkin product, i.e. the product of the three matrices R, A, and P.'
 %}
{% include qanda question='Is the operator complexity acceptable?' answer='No, we would prefer a number that is closer to 1.'  %}

Now, let us see what happens if we coarsen more aggressively on the finest level:

```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amgpcg -P 2 2 2 -iout 1 -agg_nl 1
```
We now receive the following output for average number of nonzeroes and complexities:

                operator = 1.348475
                memory = 1.700654
```
As you can see, the number of levels, the number of nonzeroes per rows and the complexities have decreased.
{% include qanda question='How does the number of iterations and the time change?' answer='The number of iterations increases (17 vs. 11), but total time is less (0.70 vs 0.97)'  %}

Now let us use aggressive coarsening in the first two levels.
```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -amgpcg -P 2 2 2 -iout 1 -agg_nl 2
```
{% include qanda question='What happens to complexities, number of iterations and total time?' answer='Complexities decrease further to 1.22, but the number of iterations is increasing to 26 and total time increases as well. Choosing to aggressively coarsen on the second level does not lead to further time savings, but gives further memory savings. If achieving the shortest time is the objective, coarsen aggressively on the second level is not adviced.'  %}

So far, we achieved the best overall time to solve a Poisson problem on a cube of size $$100 \times 100 \times$$ using conjugate gradient preconditioned with AMG with one level of aggressive coarsening.

How would a structured solver perform on this problem?
We now use the driver for the structured interface, which will also give various input options by typing
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -help
```

To run the structured solver PFMG for this problem type
```
mpirun -np 8 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -P 2 2 2 -pfmg
```
{% include qanda question='How does the number of iterations and the time change?' answer='The number of iterations 35, but the total time is less (0.26)'  %}

Now run it as a preconditioner for conjugate gradient.
```
mpirun -np 8 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -pfmgpcg -P 2 2 2
```
{% include qanda question='How does the number of iterations and the time change?' answer='The number of iterations 14, but the total time is less (0.15)'  %}

To get even better total time, now run the non-Galerkin version.

```
mpirun -np 8 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -pfmgpcg -P 2 2 2 -rap 1
```
{% include qanda question='How does the number of iterations and the time change?' answer='The number of iterations remains 14, but the total time is less (0.12)'  %}

### Third Set of Runs (Comparing GPU to CPU performance)

We will now compare the performance of GPU to CPU. 
Since there are 16 cores available on the CPU, we will use 16 MPI tasks for the CPU runs.
In contrast, there is only 1 GPU, so there will be no communication using MPI.

Let us first run a small Poisson problem on a 20 x 20 x 20 grid using CG preconditioned with AMG and PFMG
using optimal settings to get best total times.
```
mpirun -np 16 ./ij -amgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 20 20 20
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij_gpu -amgpcg -gn 20 20 20
```
```
mpirun -np 16 ./struct -pfmgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 20 20 20
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct_gpu -pfmgpcg -gn 20 20 20
```
{% include qanda question='What do you observe?' answer='The CPU runs are faster than the GPU runs for AMG-PCG and PFMG-PCG. There is not sufficient work for the GPU to offset the startup cost. PFMG-PCG is faster than AMG-PCG.' %}

Now let us consider a larger problem of size 100 x 100 x 100.
```
mpirun -np 16 ./ij -amgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 100 100 100
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij_gpu -amgpcg -gn 100 100 100
```
```
mpirun -np 16 ./struct -pfmgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 100 100 100
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct_gpu -pfmgpcg -gn 100 100 100
```
{% include qanda question='How did the situation change?' answer='Now the GPU runs are faster than the CPU runs. We observe a speedup of about 2 for AMG-PCG and for PFMG-PCG. PFMG-PCG is significantly faster than AMG-PCG.' %}

Now let us consider a larger problem of size 200 x 200 x 200.
```
mpirun -np 16 ./ij -amgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 200 200 200
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij_gpu -amgpcg -gn 200 200 200
```
```
mpirun -np 16 ./struct -pfmgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 200 200 200
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct_gpu -pfmgpcg -gn 200 200 200
```
{% include qanda question='This is the problem shown in the slides. What speedups do you observe on Polaris compared to the results from Theta?' %}

We can find the cross-over point, at which CPU and GPU times are approximately the same, at 80 x 80 x 80 for AMG-PCG and at 65 x 65 x 65 for PFMG-PCG.
```
mpirun -np 16 ./ij -amgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 80 80 80
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij_gpu -amgpcg -gn 80 80 80
```
```
mpirun -np 16 ./struct -pfmgpcg -P 4 2 2 -gn 65 65 65
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct_gpu -pfmgpcg -gn 65 65 65
```

Let us now consider a diffusion problem with a 27-point stencil to see the effect of a system with a somewhat denser matrix on the performance.
```
mpirun -np 16 ./ij -amgpcg -P 4 2 2 -27pt -gn 100 100 100
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij_gpu -amgpcg -27pt -gn 100 100 100
```
{% include qanda question='What speedup do we observe now?' answer='We now observe a speedup of about 3.5, which is higher than the speedup 2 we got for the Laplace problem with a 7-point stencil.' %}

Where is the cross-over point for this problem? Hint: Try -gn 62 62 62. Note that it is lower than for the Laplace problem.

### Additional Exercises 

We will now consider a two-dimensional problem with a rotated anisotropy on a rectangular domain.
Let us begin with a grid-aligned anisotropy.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 0 -pcg -iout 3
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 0 -gmres -k 50 -iout 3
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 0 -bicgstab -iout 3
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 0 -amg -iout 3
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 0 -pfmg
```
{% include qanda question='What do you observe?' answer='The residual norms for all solvers improve, but only AMG and PFMG converge within less than 1000 iterations.' %}

Now let us rotate the anisotropy by 45 degrees.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 45 -amg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 45 -amgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 45 -amggmres
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 45 -pfmg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 45 -pfmgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 45 -pfmggmres
```

{% include qanda question='Does the result change? What is the order of the solvers with regard to time?' answer='The order from slowest to fastest is: PFMG, PFMG-GMRES, PFMG-CG, AMG, AMG-GMRES, AMG-CG. PFMG does not work well for non-grid-aligned anisotropies, but convergence improves when PFMG is combined with a Krylov solver. AMG can handle non-grid-aligned anisotropies well.' %}

Now let us rotate the anisotropy by 30 degrees.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -amg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -amgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -pfmg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -pfmgpcg
```

{% include qanda question='Does the result change? What is the order of the solvers with regard to time?' answer='The order from slowest to fastest is: PFMG, AMG, AMG-CG, PFMG-CG. While AMG is signifcantly better than PFMG, this problem is harder for it than the previous problem. PFMG-CG is faster here than AMG-CG.' %}

Let us now scale up the problem for AMG-CG and PFMG-CG.
```
mpirun -np 2 ./ij -P 2 1 -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -amgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 4 ./ij -P 2 2 -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -amgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 8 ./ij -P 4 2 -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -amgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 2 ./struct -P 2 1 1 -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -pfmgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 4 ./struct -P 2 2 1 -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -pfmgpcg
```
```
mpirun -np 8 ./struct -P 4 2 1 -rotate -n 300 300 -eps 0.01 -alpha 30 -pfmgpcg
```

{% include qanda question='How do the solvers scale?' answer='Both solvers scale well with regard to iterations, with PFMG-CG taking more iterations, but overall less time than AMG-CG.' %}



We now consider the diffusion-convection equation

$$-\Delta u + a \nabla \cdot u = f$$

on a cuboid with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The diffusion part is discretized using central finite differences, and upwind finite differences are used for the advection term.
For $$a = 0$$ we just get the Poisson equation, but when $$a > 0$$ we get a nonsymmetric linear system.

Now let us apply Krylov solvers to the convection-diffusion equation with $$a=10$$, starting with conjugate gradient.

```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -pcg
```
{% include qanda question='What do you observe? Why?' answer='PCG fails, because the linear system is nonsymmetric.' %}

Now try GMRES(20), BiCGSTAB, and AMG with and without aggressive coarsening.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -gmres -k 20
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -bicgstab
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -amg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./ij -n 50 50 50 -difconv -a 10 -amg -agg_nl 1
```
{% include qanda question='What do you observe? Order the solvers in the order of slowest to fastest solver for this problem!' answer='BiCGSTAB, GMRES and AMG with or without aggressive coarsening solve the problem. The order slowest to fastest for this problem is: GMRES(20), AMG, BiCGSTAB, AMG with aggressive coarsening.' %}

Let us solve the problem using structured multigrid solvers.
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -a 10 -pfmg
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -a 10 -pfmg -rap 1
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -a 10 -pfmggmres
```
```
mpirun -np 1 ./struct -n 50 50 50 -a 10 -pfmggmres -rap 1
```

{% include qanda question='What do you observe? Which solver fails? What is the order of the remaining solvers in terms of number of iterations? Which solver is the fastest.' answer='The non-Galerkin version of PFMG as alone solver fails. The order from largest to least number of iterations is: Non-Galerkin PFMG-GMRES, PFMG, PFMG-GMRES. But PFMG alone solves the problem faster.' %}

## Out-Brief

We experimented with several Krylov solvers, GMRES, conjugate gradient and BiCGSTAB, and observed the effect of increasing the size of the Krylov space for restarted GMRES. We investigated why multigrid methods are preferable over generic solvers like conjugate gradient for large suitable PDE problems.
Additional improvements can be achieved when using them as preconditioners for Krylov solvers like conjugate gradient.
For unstructured multigrid solvers, it is important to keep complexities low, since large complexities lead to slow solve times and require much memory.
For structured problems, solvers that take advantage of the structure of the problem are more efficient than unstructured solvers.
